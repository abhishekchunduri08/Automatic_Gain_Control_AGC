# Automatic_Gain_Control_AGC

In the age of radio circuits and RF technology development, fading of input signal's amplitude
received due to various factors like attenuation and propagation losses during transmission and
external environmental factors was very common problem . 

This required continuous adjustments in the receiver's side gain in order to maintain an
approximately constant output signal.

Such a situation led to the design of circuits, whose main objective was to maintain a constant signal level
at the output, irrespective of the signal's variations at the input side of the system. Originally,
these circuits were designed under the name of Automatic Volume Control (AVC) circuits , a few
years later they were generalized under the name of Automatic Gain Control (AGC) circuits.

If the input signal is too low, then the AGC system will increase (amplify) the signal and if is too
high, the AGC system will decrease(attenuate) it to maintain a constant level as much as possible.

Nowadays, AGC circuits can be found in any device or system where wide amplitude variations in
the output signal could lead to a lost of information or to an unacceptable performance of the
system. All modern day receivers are furnished with Automatic Gain Control, which enables
tuning to stations of varying signal strengths without appreciable change in the volume of the
output signal.In addition, principle of Automatic Gain Control helps to smooth out the rapid
fading which may occur during long-distance transmission and reception and indirectly prevents
overloading of the amplifying system which might otherwise have occurred.
